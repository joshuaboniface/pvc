# PVC CLI client manual

The PVC CLI client is built with Click, a Python framework for creating self-documenting CLI applications. It interfaces directly with the Zookeeper cluster to send and receive information about the cluster with no authentication.

Use the `-h` option at any level of the `pvc` CLI command to receive help about the available commands and options.
